## 🖥️ Usage

You can run the scraper in two ways: using the **GUI (Streamlit)** or the **Command Line**.

### Option 1: Web Interface (Streamlit) - Recommended

The easiest way to use the tool.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

This will open `http://localhost:8501` in your browser.
-   **Region/City**: Enter the target city (e.g., "Moscow").
-   **Search Query**: Enter the business type (e.g., "Coffee shop").
-   **Max Results**: Limit how many places to scrape.
-   **Headless Mode**:
    -   **Checked (Default)**: Browser runs hidden in the background. Use this for servers or if you don't want to be disturbed.
    -   **Unchecked**: You will see the Chrome window open and navigate automatically. Useful for debugging or seeing what's happening.

### Option 2: Command Line Interface (CLI)

For integration into scripts or quick runs.

```bash
python main.py "Coffee shop Moscow" --max 10
```

**Arguments:**
-   `query`: The search term (e.g., "Coffee shop Moscow").
-   `--max`, `-m`: Maximum number of results (default: 10).
-   `--headless`: Run without visible browser window.
-   `--screenshots`: Capture a screenshot of each place's website (requires Playwright).

## 🤖 Advanced: Running on a Server

This tool uses **Selenium** and **Chrome**. To run it on a headless Linux server (e.g., VPS), ensure you have:
1.  Chrome installed (`google-chrome-stable`).
2.  Drivers installed (`chromedriver` is managed automatically by `webdriver-manager`).
3.  Run with **Headless Mode** enabled.
